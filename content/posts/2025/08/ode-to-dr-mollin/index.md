My primary care doctor for the last 20+ years told me he was retiring this morning.

It's hard to figure out where to start with this one.  How do you capture all the feelings of gratitude for a guy that's been your doctor for over 20 years?  Nevermind the fact that he's incredible at what he does, that he quite literally saved my life, just the fact that he's been faithfully serving his community as a primary care doctor for 20 years is incredible.

I became a patient of Dr. Daniel Mollin some time around 2003.  Here's a short list of major life events he's been through with me:
 - Birth of my daughter
 - Divorce
 - Re-marriage
 - Major career shifts and turmoil
 - A life threatening heart disease
 - My father's declining health
 - Starting graduate school
 - Countless injuries and illnesses

You might wonder why so much of that list is just random life events as opposed to ailments.  Dr. Mollin ran his practice with a focus on whole human wellness.  If you didn't want to engage that way, he'd take you off his patient list.  He actually threatened to do that to me when I tried to weasel out of an annual physical about 15 years ago.  He was not interested in transactional healthcare, and his conviction about that was catching.  Every year we'd spend a solid hour having a deep conversation about all the things going on in my life, including things with friends and family, and how that was affecting me.  How was my exercise and diet?  Any big life changes happening?  How are you sleeping?  How often do you wake up to pee at night?

I was always completely open and honest with him.  I never felt like I needed to lie or hold anything back.  That deep relationship meant he knew when I started drinking a little more, when stress was getting to me, when I was getting out of balance.  He was part doctor, part therapist most of the time.

That also allowed him to give me the most valuable, targeted, and applicable advice of anyone in my life outside my Dad.  Dr. Mollin challenged me on a deep level.  He brooked no nonsense, he didn't compromise on the important things, but he never once made me feel anything but positive and motivated.  Every bit of advice he gave was achievable, supported by personal stories of his own challenges and growth, and I left his office every year feeling like I could make improvements.  And every year I did.

Around 2009/2010 I was 29 years old and in great health.  Then suddenly I wasn't.  I had no energy and I couldn't figure out why.  After a couple weeks of that I went in to see Dr. Mollin.  Because he knew me so well, when he heard a little heart murmur he decided to do an echocardiogram "just in case."  It turns out a virus had attacked my heart and weakened it.  My ejection fraction was less than 30%, which is heart failure territory.  Cardiomyopathy had an 80% mortality rate within 5 years.  I was scared - it felt like a death sentence.  

Dr. Mollin made sure I got connected to excellent cardiologists and diligently partnered with on my case.  He gave me constant encouragement and support, and he never let me believe this was it for me.  After we saw a bit of improvement thanks to beta blockers and other drugs, he encouraged me to start trying to run, which sounded insane to me at the time.  But I kept getting better, slowly but surely.  He was there with me a year later for a stress echo which showed a lot of recovery, and he cleared me to go back to playing hockey.  Every positive step was celebrated - he made sure I focused on the progress we were making rather than getting distracted with comparing myself to what I used to be able to do.

I believe if I'd had any other doctor I likely would not have been diagnosed nearly as quickly, and my chances of survival would have been far less.  I give him a tremendous amount of the credit in my being alive today.

When work and life stress was affecting me, he gave me simple but effective advice and took time to explain why these ideas worked physiologically.  If I had trouble sleeping, he said I should get up, do some stretches, and journal.  Just write down all the things I'm thinking about and let my mind put those things to rest.  It sounded lame, but worked incredibly well.  I never took sleeping pills and got back to healthy sleep habits.

When I was drinking more during Covid, he didn't judge.  He showed me how that was showing up on my labs.  Nothing horrible, but it was there.  He didn't tell me to stop (probably wouldn't have worked), he advised me to be mindful and make sure I thought of alcohol like a treat, not a medicine.  It was powerful advice and it helped me change my behavior.

When I broke my ankle in June, it was his voice in my head telling me not to focus on what I _couldn't_ do, but rather to think about and take joy in the things I _could_ do.  It was guidance he'd given me for years that had sunk in deeply to my soul.  That didn't make it easy, but it motivated me to get in the garage in my big stupid boot and do seated weight exercises.  

In over 20 years I can count on one hand how many times he's suggested pharmacological intervention.  Not because he is anti-pharma, but because we haven't needed it.  His focus on health and wellness means I haven't needed medications very often.  As a result, my health journey has been sustainable and steady.  I would never have learned those skills and had this level of success with my health without his influence.

When he told me today he was retiring we both got emotional.  I'm so deeply grateful to him for the way he ran his practice and for all the ways he's helped me achieve greater health.  I'm nervous about having a new doctor, especially one younger than I am... But I'm confident with the foundation I have thanks to Dr. Mollin. I'll be okay.

To all of you who don't have a primary care doctor, or who treat your health like a drive-through fast food place you just go to when you're sick, I implore you to change your mindset.  Not everyone will be as fortunate as I was to find someone like Dr. Mollin, but they are out there and the search is more than worth it!  And regardless, you can and should take ownership of your health regardless of who your doctor is.

And to you, Dr. Mollin, please know that you have had an incredibly outsized and positive impact on my life.  I am a happier, healthier, better man today thanks to you.  I hope that one day someone might feel towards me a fraction of the level of gratitude I feel for you and the work you've done.  I also sincerely hope you enjoy your very well earned retirement!
