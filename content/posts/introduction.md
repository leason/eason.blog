Hello.  I'm Lee Eason.

Like you, I'm still in development.  My career has been anything but linear or planned out.  For a bit, I thought I was going to be a [herpetologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpetology).  Then I got bit by a 12 foot [Olive Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liasis_olivaceus) and quickly switched to English teaching. Then I found out grammar was basically math and decided I'd rather teach History.

Then I took an internship at a tech company in the late 90's and discovered the incredible world of the technology business. The people I worked with were so passionate and fun.  I deferred my dream of teaching and decided to try and make my way in the tech field.

I have eclectic interests.  For a while I rode horses, trained people on how to work with them, and I even rode a bull.  I've flown airplanes, played chess, acted in commercials, wrote stories and poems, played guitar and sang in public (still do), had two incredible kids, built carpentry projects, worked on my cars, drank a lot of wine and scotch, spoke at conferences, played ice hockey, fought in karate tournaments, surfed, taught sunday school, and studied philosophy.  I still enjoy most of those things today.

Over the past 23+ years I've built a career in software development.  From coding to architecture to leadership and transformation, I love the complexity of the human challenges in building technology driven products.  I've found my voice as a writer, speaker, and leader thanks to many amazing mentors along the way.  I use this blog as an outlet for things that could help others, drawing on my personal and professional experiences.

For me, it's never been about the one's and zero's.  It's always been about the infinite and beautiful shades of grey in between.
