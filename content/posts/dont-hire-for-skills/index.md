When I hire team members I look for these attributes in this order:
1. Attitude
1. Aptitude
1. Technical Ability

It's an approach I learned from @RalphKasuba (he's not active on twitter) many years ago and it has served me well.  Recently I gained even more respect for the approach to putting technical skills last, so let's start there.

## Technical Skills
These are the keywords hiring systems look for on resumes.  They are the hard skills the person has learned over their career so far.  The emphasis on these things is one of the many reasons I think that resumes are poor hiring tools.  Do I really care either way that you worked with embedded systems ten years ago?  Or that you don't have production experience with a brand new, cutting edge technology that has only really been popular for the past couple years?

Think about it this way: the average tenure at a company I worked at recently was almost seven years.  That's a great tenure.  Given the cost of turnover, we're saving the company a lot of money.

During the last seven years, AWS alone has launched a completely new set of products that has revolutionized how we build technical solutions.  ECS, ECR, DynamoDb, CloudWatch, Kinesis, Fargate, Lambda, and EKS just to name a few.  There are entire products built today on just those services.

If you are hiring people with the skills you need today, but ignore their ability to learn and their eagerness to do so, you are locking yourself into a fate of having legacy solutions that will only get more expensive to maintain and difficult to hire for.
