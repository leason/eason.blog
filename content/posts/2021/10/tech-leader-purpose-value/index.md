At Edward Jones we say that someone is "responsible" to another person instead of saying that they "report" to them.  It's a subtle change, but I like it.  Being a leader carries a heavy responsibility.  So what does it mean to be responsible for engineering teams?  At Jones we call those people Product Delivery Managers (PDMs), but in this article I'll just refer to them as Managers.

## What makes Managers unique
If Product Owners (POs) are responsible for the **What** and the **Why** of where a team focuses, the Manager is responsible for the **How** (which dictates the **when**).  Most companies have one PO per engineering team, while Managers might be responsible for several teams at once.

Look back at the image above. In my opinion, the primary value of a manager is that they know how the clock works. While the PO is focused on delivery of value, the Manager understands how to diagnose when the clock hands aren't working as well as they could. Managers are accountable for making the clock work better.

Managers are uniquely capable of understanding the connection between:

- operational maturity and user experience
- agile maturity and customer satisfaction
- test automation and speed of delivery

Even more critical: they understand how individual actions of a team member influence outcomes.

## How do Managers drive change
A great Manager has the influencing skills to actually bring about improvement to these things that other people/teams are responsible for. They partner with Shared Technology Teams, such as an infrastructure monitoring group, or a developer tools team, to bring about change that helps their teams improve.

Managers are the last line of defense when it comes to the behaviors of the individuals on their teams. Individuals need guidance and coaching, usually from multiple sources, to learn and grow. Agile coaches, Scrum Masters, Site Reliability Engineers, Architects, and QA Experts are all examples of roles that might offer great coaching to individual team members outside of their Manager.

Most organizations utilize regular performance management cycles. Once a year, for example, a Manager will decide what label best describes the performance of each of their direct reports.  If the Manager is good at their job, these labels will never be a surprise for their folks.  It should simply memorialize a series of conversations that have been taking place throughout the review period.





InfoSec experts talk about "Defense in Depth."  The principle is that you don't rely on one method of protection, because it will have weaknesses.  By layering multiple methods of protection together, you mitigate the weaknesses of any one layer and form a solid defense.  Even in those environments some safeguards are there to catch when an attacker somehow makes it all the way through.
