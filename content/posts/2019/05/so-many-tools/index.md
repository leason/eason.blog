Look at that picture.  It's actually awe inspiring.  Terrifying, even.

Every one of those tools provides value.  In a big enough company there will be passionate team members making a case for buying or deploying the vast majority of those tools.  They'll spend time building a case for the purchase, and try to convince IT to put their tool rollout at the top of the priority list.  In isolation, each case will make sense and appear to help the firm do something great, save time, and provide a better experience for your customers.  They will have senior leaders in groups like portfolio management, IT, product management, software development, customer service, and business analytics all arguing over a finite amount of funds available over which things to buy.

**You know you need to guard your team's focus.  So how do you choose?**

I'll invoke Steve Jobs here:

>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.

## Align tool choices to business needs
